# CropConnect 🌿 (Prototype Project)

⚠️ **Note:** This project was an early **experimental prototype** built while exploring the idea of a farmer data management system. My current and actively developed full-stack project is:

## 🧪 About This Prototype

**CropConnect** was an initial version created to understand:
- Structuring fullstack apps around farmer and crop data
- React component layout with Bootstrap UI
- Basic routing, state handling, and simple Excel file interactions

It helped lay the groundwork for building a more robust and production-ready version, now maintained in [UdhyanSetu_Final](https://github.com/msv-akshat/UdhyanSetu_Final).
